<p>i hate syntax highlighters<br />
i really do<br />
repo name is not a typo</p>

<p>this is an attempt to create a syntax highlighting theme for atom that i find okay. i will base it on a style guide i created for university math scripts, which aren’t at all like code. but i had a few ideas doing that which i want to use.</p>

<h2 id="general-ideas-tbc">general ideas (tbc)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>too many colours are shit and mainly irritate you. don’t do that.
    <ul>
      <li>if the colours are not structuring but destructuring your code, they probably should be adjusted.</li>
      <li>use such a small number of colours that you actually recognise them individually and they will actually <em>help</em> you at coding. maybe a max of 4 or so. idk.</li>
      <li>this also means the highlighting will be very personally adjusted to <em>me</em> and how <em>i</em> program and it will develop over time. fork for your own flavour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>colours should have a more general meaning. like, not just one syntax thing, but maybe a group of things that have familiar associations.
    <ul>
      <li>this can probably be quite personal as well. i don’t even know.</li>
      <li>example: green means ~~clean.~~ definition. and maybe even assignments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if you associate meanings to colours: <em>use them!</em> this is a great way to help your mind, as it already has the right associations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concrete-ideas">concrete ideas</h2>
<p>i’m doing this highlighting for js, so this is what i’ll base my examples on.
i thought of the following 4 groups and colours:
* standard (colour: black or white)
  * this group is the one that has the “standard text” inside it and renders monochrome
  * this means inside it should be the stuff that is most used in our language and “not anything special”
  * BUT: To seperate all the “non-special” things from each other we can use font weight and stuff
  * in my mind this means:
    * names (of variables and constants)
    * ~~language keywords [bold]~~ this did not work out, i added an extra color for that (q_q)
    * comments [lighter font weight than standard, italic]
* assignments (colour: green)
  * this group is for “writing stuff into a thing with a name”
  * in my mind this means:
    * assigning a value to a thing with a name. in js this means the = character: <code>y = 'abc';</code> has <code>y</code> and <code>''</code> from the keyword group and <code>=</code> from assignment group.
    * name definitions: when a name gets defined, like in <code>const x = 15;</code>: <code>const</code> is a keyword, <code>x =</code> is both in the definition group.
* literals (colour: blue)
  * this group is for “writing a literal value”
  * in my mind this means:
    * numbers
    * strings (but beware: “ “, ` `, / / and so on are language keywords, so they have a different colour)
    * bools (true/false)
    * object literals (this weird json-y thing in js)
* function calls (colour: red)
  * this group is for the action of calling a function (not just the name of one, a non-invoked name is in the standard group)
  * in my mind this means:
    * names that get invoked. example <code>awesomeSnytax(value);</code>. <code>awesomeSnytax</code> should be red, parantheses are standard group though.
    * infix operators, like <code>===</code> and <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;</code>, these are also just function calls that take arguments from the left and right side and return something.
* keywords (colour: yellowish-orange and [bold])
  * i wish i didn’t have to make this group but variables and keywords in the same group was too confusing.</p>

<p>this is my progress so far. probably looks shitty in other languages and is still bugged i guess.<br />
the parentheses after if/while/etc shouldn’t be red, but there was nothing i could do about that for now.<br />

<h3 id="when-will-you-start-actually-making-the-thing">when will you start actually making the thing?</h3>
<p>~~idk. maybe tomorrow. or the day after. or next week. maybe not at all, if that’s the case just feel inspired and fork this or do your own. i don’t care.~~<br />
ha, i already started!
### why are you using UK english?
idk. it felt appropriate for somehow ranting about shitty syntax highlighters.</p>
