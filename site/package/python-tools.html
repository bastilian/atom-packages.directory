<p>Some handy tools to make developing Python code in Atom even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Goes along really nicely with the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python">autocomplete-python</a> package to provide a full Python IDE experience in Atom.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>This package uses <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jedi">Jedi</a> in addition to other custom code to provide numerous pieces of functionality to make you more productive:</p>

<h3 id="show-usages">Show Usages</h3>
<p>Default shortcut: <code>ctrl+alt+u</code></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/coOlBn7.gif?1" alt="demo" /></p>

<p>Select the usages of a specific symbol in your file.</p>

<p>This is particularly handy for quickly refactoring/renaming variables and other symbols within your code.</p>

<p>Currently only supports detection of symbols within the same file. This will be extended to support usages outside the current file in the future.</p>

<h3 id="goto-definition">Goto Definition</h3>
<p>Default shortcut: <code>ctrl+alt+g</code></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iXHY7HE.gif?1" alt="demo" /></p>

<p>Go to to the original definition of the symbol under the cursor. This will open the corresponding file if it is not already open.</p>

<p>Files which form part of the standard library / are installed as third party modules are still opened, which is a really nice way of analysing and understanding behavior of code.</p>

<h3 id="select-string-contents">Select String Contents</h3>
<p>Default shortcut: <code>ctrl+alt+e</code></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tUeduTK.gif?1" alt="demo" /></p>

<p>Select the entire contents of the string currently being selected.</p>

<p>Works with single line as well as block strings.</p>

<h4 id="more-tools-to-come">More tools to come?</h4>
<p>Ideas and feature requests are welcome. Some ideas of potential features to be added:
* Swap string delimiters between ‘ and “
* Show usages and provide the ability to rename across multiple files
* Select entire symbols</p>

<h2 id="windows-support">Windows Support</h2>
<p>Windows should work, however I do not have access to a Windows machine and cannot therefore test out releases.</p>

<p>I have builds being tested on appveyor which should prevent any obvious errors from causing breakages. I have now also setup a virtual machine to test changes, but a lot of the issues that I would catch through normal day to day usage will not be found and I’ll have to rely to the community to make me aware of them.</p>

<p>If you have any issue running this package on windows then please open an <a href="https://github.com/michaelaquilina/python-tools/issues">Issue</a>.</p>

<p>Common Problem: “python-tools was unable to find your machine’s python executable”
* Make sure python is installed on your machine (jedi is used internally which runs off python)
* Make sure your python executable is added to your PATH environment variable</p>

<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work In Progress</h2>

<p>This Atom package is very much a Work In Progress and is far from currently being perfect! There are a lot of things I will be looking to improve.</p>

<p>If you find anything which does not seem like expected behavior or have any suggestions, feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/michaelaquilina/python-tools/issues">Issue</a> on my Github page.</p>
